# Data Source API Analyst Test

This repository contains the technical assignment for the Data Source API Analyst position. The task involves working with the GitHub API, extracting data using Google Colab, documenting the process, and delivering the results.

## Repository Structure

- `/Content`: Python code, API documentation, error handling, rate limits, and data-cleaning approach.
- `/Postman_Collection`: Google Colab notebook used for API testing and data extraction.

## Reflection 

This exercise allowed me to explore and implement core concepts of working with REST APIs, including authentication, pagination, and data extraction using Python.

## Notes

- This assignment was completed using Google Colab exclusively; therefore, there is no Postman collection JSON file.
- The Personal Access Token used for authentication is **not included** in any committed files to protect security.
