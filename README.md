# Data Source API Analyst Test

This repository contains the technical assignment for the Data Source API Analyst position. The task involves working with the GitHub API, extracting data using Google Colab, documenting the process, and delivering the results.

## Repository Structure

- `/Content`: Python code, API documentation, error handling, rate limits, and data-cleaning approach.
- `/Postman_Collection`: Google Colab notebook used for API testing and data extraction.

## Reflection (Part 5)
