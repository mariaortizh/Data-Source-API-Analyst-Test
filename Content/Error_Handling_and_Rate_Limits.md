# Error Handling and Rate Limits

- Authentication errors (e.g., 401 Unauthorized) are handled by verifying the validity and permissions of the Personal Access Token.
- Rate limits imposed by GitHub API (typically 5000 requests per hour for authenticated users) are respected by including pauses between requests.
- If a rate limit error (403) occurs, the program can be enhanced to wait and retry after the reset time.
- Basic error checking is implemented by verifying HTTP status codes before processing responses.
